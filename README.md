# Wagerly

## Sports social media site build with React, TypeScript, MobX, SCSS, and Firebase.

I like building these social media sites to practice my coding skills. The goal of this project is to be an updated version of my previous Wagerly project. Im focusing on speed, style, and having a good user experience. 

In my previous project I used Nextjs, Prisma, and MongoDB to build the site. While I enjoyed working with those technologies (Nextjs, Prisma) I had performance issues when dealing with a lot of data. This project wont be using Nextjs and Prisma.
