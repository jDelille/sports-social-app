# Wagerly

## Sports social media site build with React, TypeScript, MobX, SCSS, and Firebase.

I like building these social media sites to practice my coding skills. The goal of this project is to be an updated version of my previous Wagerly project. Im focusing on speed, style, and having a good user experience.
